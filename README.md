DeskDisplay
===========

A basic class to create a window that could be used to put views on and interact with on the desktop level. The main purpose of this is to provide the base functionality so you have the window set up so you can then do things similar to GeekTool. This way you have the option of making it less resource intensive, also have the option of creating more complex things as it's completely up to you.
